SATISFACTION ON LAPROSCOPIC SURGERY
Kailash Hospital, Noida
     Excellent
We are very much satisfied with the laproscopic surgery done by Dr Rahul Dev.It was not a simple case as already attended for same surgery in another private nursing home. Dr executed the surgery very professionally and we got relieved from the tough situation.staff behaviour is really impressive especially Mam "Aarti " she is so polite in nature , does all the formalities by her own I've never seen such helpful staff in any other hospital.

THANK YOU SIR- DR. RAHUL DEv
     Excellent
My self Renu, Age 36 years. I was suffering from gall Bladder stones. This left us very worried but I recently had my first visit with Dr. Rahul Dev of Kailash Hospital Sector-27 Noida and it was a delight. he immediately made me feel very comfortable and it felt as if he had been my doctor for years. This doctor is truly exceptional! From the moment I entered the doors to the office, I felt welcomed, cared for, and completely at ease. Dr. Rahul Dev is a great doctor! .

I am from Haldwani, Nainital. Feeling excited to share my feedback for my heart surgery that happened 14 years back in 2009 at Kailash Hospital, Sector 27, Noida. The surgery was conducted successfully by the hands of Dr. Satish Mathews. I'm regularly taking his consultations regarding medicines and still I'm feeling fit. I have no words to express towards Dr. Mathews for his greatness and friendly behaviour. Thank you doctor Mathews Sir!!-Everyone will be by your side at your best – we are those who will be with you at your worst.
